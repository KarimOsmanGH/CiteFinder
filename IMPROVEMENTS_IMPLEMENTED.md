# Search Relevance & UI Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Date: 2025-10-16

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Search Relevance Problem** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Whatever statement users typed, they got papers that were not related to the statement.

**Root Causes Identified**:
- OR logic in searches returned papers matching ANY term instead of ALL terms
- Weak key term extraction included too many generic words
- Low similarity threshold (40%) allowed irrelevant papers through
- Basic similarity scoring didn't understand context or phrases

### 2. **UI/Layout Problem** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The view after submitting a statement was cluttered and hard to navigate.

**User Request**: Two columns or sidebar menu for better organization.

## Improvements Implemented

### A. Search Relevance Fixes

#### 1. **Improved Search Query Construction** (`app/api/process-text/route.ts`)
**Before**:
```typescript
const orQuery = keyTerms.slice(0, 5).join(' OR ')
// Example: "drones OR environmental OR monitoring" 
// Result: Papers with ANY of these words
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Extract important phrases (2-3 word combinations)
const phrases = []
for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(words.length - 1, 3); i++) {
  phrases.push(`"${words[i]} ${words[i+1]}"`)
}

// Use phrase matching + AND logic
const phraseQuery = phrases.length > 0 
  ? `${phrases[0]} AND (${keyTerms.slice(0, 4).join(' OR ')})`
  : keyTerms.slice(0, 5).join(' AND ')

// Example: "environmental monitoring" AND (drones OR uav OR systems)
// Result: Papers must have the phrase AND at least one key term
```

**Impact**: 
- ✅ Papers must match key phrases, not just individual words
- ✅ AND logic ensures relevance
- ✅ Fallback strategies prevent no results

#### 2. **Enhanced Key Term Extraction** (`app/api/process-text/route.ts`)
**Before**:
- Only 30 stop words → kept generic terms like "using", "based", "improves"
- No phrase preservation → "machine learning" split into "machine" + "learning"
- All words treated equally → no prioritization

**After**:
- **80+ stop words** including:
  - Action verbs: "using", "used", "improve", "enhance", "provide"
  - Generic terms: "based", "various", "different", "several"
  - Filler words: "through", "during", "between"

- **Phrase preservation** for important academic terms:
  - "machine learning", "deep learning", "neural network"
  - "remote sensing", "environmental monitoring", "climate change"
  - And 10+ more domain-specific phrases

- **Smart term selection**:
  - Preserves important phrases as single units
  - Filters out all stop words
  - Returns top 6 meaningful terms

**Example**:
```
Input: "Machine learning improves drone navigation using computer vision"

Before: ["machine", "learning", "improves", "drone", "navigation", "using", "computer", "vision"]

After: ["machine learning", "computer vision", "drone", "navigation"]
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Searches for "machine learning" as a phrase, not separate words
- ✅ Removes generic words that dilute relevance
- ✅ Preserves academic terminology

#### 3. **Improved Similarity Scoring** (`app/api/process-text/route.ts`)
**Before**:
- Simple word matching: 1 point for each term match
- 25% minimum for any match
- Basic exact match bonus: +20 points

**After**:
- **No matches = 0% similarity** (was giving 25% for any match)
- **Single match capped at 30%** (prevents false positives)
- **3+ matches get minimum 50%** (rewards comprehensive matches)
- **Exact phrase in title: +30 bonus** (huge boost for relevant papers)
- **Exact phrase in abstract: +20 bonus**
- **Key phrase bonuses: +15 each** (rewards multi-word terms)

**Example Comparison**:
```
Search: "drone environmental monitoring"

Paper 1: "Drone Delivery Systems" 
Before: 25% (has "drone")
After: 0% (only 1 term, no relevance)

Paper 2: "Environmental Drone Monitoring Systems"
Before: 60% (has all 3 terms)
After: 85% (has all 3 terms + phrase bonus)
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Irrelevant papers (1 term match) now filtered out
- ✅ Relevant papers (multiple matches) score higher
- ✅ Phrase matches get significant boost

#### 4. **Higher Quality Threshold** (`components/RelatedPapers.tsx`)
**Before**:
```typescript
const filteredPapers = papers.filter(paper => paper.similarity >= 40)
// 40% = 2 out of 5 terms matched
```

**After**:
```typescript
const filteredPapers = papers.filter(paper => paper.similarity >= 50)
// 50% = at least half the terms matched + context/phrases
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Only high-quality matches shown to users
- ✅ Reduces noise and irrelevant results
- ✅ Improves user trust in recommendations

### B. UI/Layout Improvements

#### **Two-Column Layout with Sidebar Navigation** (`app/page.tsx`)

**Before**: Single column with all sections stacked vertically
- Hard to navigate between sections
- No sense of progress
- Unclear what to do next

**After**: Professional two-column layout
- **Left Sidebar (sticky)**: Progress tracker & navigation
- **Right Column**: Main content area

##### Left Sidebar Features:
1. **Progress Tracker** - Visual steps with checkmarks:
   - ✓ Step 1: Statements (X extracted)
   - ✓ Step 2: Papers (X found)
   - ✓ Step 3: Selection (X selected)
   - ✓ Step 4: Generate (Create references)

2. **Quick Navigation Buttons**:
   - "View Statements →" - scrolls to statements section
   - "View Papers →" - scrolls to papers section
   - "Generate References →" - scrolls to generator (only if papers selected)

3. **Summary Stats**:
   - Statements: X
   - Papers Found: X
   - Selected: X (in green)

##### Visual Design:
- Sticky sidebar stays visible while scrolling
- Color-coded steps: ✅ Green for complete, ⚪ Gray for pending
- Disabled state for "Generate" until papers are selected
- Smooth scroll animations between sections
- Glass morphism design with backdrop blur

**Impact**:
- ✅ Users can see their progress at a glance
- ✅ Easy navigation between sections
- ✅ Clear next steps and workflow
- ✅ Better organization and hierarchy
- ✅ Responsive design (sidebar becomes top bar on mobile)
